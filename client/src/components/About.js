                <strong>Mood Wood</strong> is a mood log created for kids that are learning to, or already can, write and read.
                It was designed as a tool to develop emotional awareness and, consequently, emotional inteligence while helping to improve literacy skills through the habit of daily writing.

                Typically, and depending on the kid’s age, it’s a work in progress. But what does this actually mean?
                In short, the basics of Emotional Intelligence in children and adults are similar. It’s just that most of us have long forgotten the first time we acquired the most basic of these skills. Such as “Wow, James feels differently than I do”.

                <strong>EI</strong> helps children understand themselves and others, communicate, and handle unpleasant feelings. Both now and later in life, it can help them develop and maintain relationships at work and more personally. 
                Studies have shown that being more aware of your emotions is linked to lower levels of social anxiety; better relationships with friends and family; higher self-esteem and lower levels of depression.

                Emotions play an important role in how we perceive and interact with our world. However, when emotions have the wrong intensity, duration, frequency, or type for a particular situation, they can also be very harmful to us. It is because of these unhelpful instances of emotions that it is beneficial to put effort into trying to get to know and control your emotions. Before we can try and exert this control, we first have to increase our emotional awareness, so that we will be more perceptive of the emotions that we are experiencing. Writing about one’s emotion, such as like keeping a log, can help with that. 
                When thinking about and describing feelings – as well as naming emotions, kids will learn how to use emotional vocabulary to convey how they feel. Understanding their own emotions and what they’re feeling will enable them to be able to identify those emotions in others, empathising with them.
